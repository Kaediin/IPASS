# IPASS - Kaedin Schouten - 2021
## About the project (IPASS)
The Individual Propaedeutic Assessment (IPASS) is the direction-specific conclusion of the propaedeutic year in my studies: HBO-ICT; direction: Artificial Intelligence. It's my chance to show what I've learned this year. In addition, IPASS has been designated as an executioner: I have to obtain at least a pass mark for this project in order to be allowed to move on to the second year of this training.

## The problem
If a candidate has to go through a program (on the [Eelloo](https://eelloo.nl) platform) with multiple, predominantly long questionnaires (such as 'Drives' and 'Personality'), this costs the candidate a lot of time. In addition, this does not seem to be an inspiring activity for every candidate.

Is it possible to use an algorithm to predict the final profile/report that candidates will receive when they have completed all questionnaires and questionnaires, based on less information and intermediately calculated scale scores?
